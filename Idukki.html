Located near Munnar, it is one of the most beautiful tea estates in India.At an altitude of 7900 feet, Kolukkumalai is the world's highest elevation tea plantation and one of the premier South Indian industries in India. This tea estate is a part of Tamil Nadu but Munnar is the most popular gateway to Kolukkumalai tea estate. The estate was built up by the British from 1920 to 1927 with the assistant of the Chettiar Brothers belonging to Bodinayakkanur, Tamilnadu, India. Sprawling over an area of 81 hectares, the estate was run by the Chettiar Brothers from 1935 to 1971. Thereafter, the Chettiar brothers transferred their rights to AJ Group in 1971.

                The Kolukkumalai Tea Estate produces tea using the orthodox method in the time-tested tea factory which means that the tea is handpicked and goes through the seven-step process, including withering, rolling, sieving, fermenting, drying, fiber extraction, and grading. Kolukkumalai tea is one of the premium teas in South India as it possesses a special flavor and freshness because of the high altitude. The Kolukkumalai Tea has been a winner of the 'Golden Leaf' award given by UPASI (The United Planters' Association of Southern India) for the best quality Tea.
